            This app is inspired by the countless factory game calculators out
            there for games like Factorio, Satisfactory, etc. that are sooo
            helpful when trying to figure out what you need when building your
            stuff.

            I was shocked to find that nothing like this existed for FF14 when I
            started crafting since I had grown accustomed to being able to use
            one of these and instantly knowing how much of what and in what
            order I needed them in.

            I made this entirely from scratch but this site is
            <em>heavily</em> inspired by the wonderful
            <a href="https://kirkmcdonald.github.io/" class="link-info">
                kirkmcdonald.github.io
            </a>
            so please check that out ~!
